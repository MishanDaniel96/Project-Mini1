# Project-Mini1
A minimal, real-time data visualization application that connects to an SQL database, processes the data using Python, and presents interactive charts via a user-friendly Streamlit web interface. Perfect for quick analytical dashboards and monitoring database changes.
This project is an end-to-end data visualization solution, bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights. The pipeline starts by reading data from a MySQL database, connecting securely . The Python script then utilizes Pandas to ingest the data, applying initial data cleaning and preprocessing steps—such as handling NaNs and ensuring correct data types—replicating work done previously in a Jupyter environment. The application then leverages Streamlit to instantly transform this cleaned and aggregated data into a fully interactive web dashboard. This dashboard includes key features like real-time KPI metrics (Total Sales, Average Rating), a dynamic sidebar filter for departments, and a clear, responsive bar chart visualizing department-wise performance. This robust, single-file application is designed for rapid deployment and provides an efficient way to monitor dynamic database changes.
